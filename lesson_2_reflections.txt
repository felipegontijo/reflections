What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When you initialize a repository, the folder is now a git-compatible repository, and the features of the git version control system are available.
	You need to do it so that you can use the git features, like commits, and be able to track your work and its progress.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is a completely separate space in which files you intend to commit are placed into. It acts as a middle-man and is helpful to set aside and organize the files together prior to committing them.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	The staging area holds what is going to be committed, and so is a good resource to identify the files that will be committed as well as the changes that will be made if I run git diff --staged.
